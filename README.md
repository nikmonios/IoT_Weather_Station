# IoT_Weather_Station
<b><i>Create an IoT application using a F103RB Nucleo board, an Arduino wather shield, and ESP8266 thing and a Raspberry PI</i></b>

<br>
<b>WORK IN PROGRESS!!!</b>
<br>

<br><strong>Development boards used: </strong>
1) STM32 F103RB Nucleo board - http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f103rb.html
2) Raspberry PI 3 - Model B  - https://www.adafruit.com/products/3055
3) Sparkfun ESP8266 Thing - https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13231
4) Arduino Weather Station - http://www2.mouser.com/ProductDetail/TE-Connectivity/DPP902S000/?qs=1fQ7IOp4WrheKF877Di7Eg%3d%3d

<strong>Flashing the boards: </strong>
<br>To flash the F103RB board, I used the cloud-based mbded IDE compiler. You can create a free account on https://os.mbed.com/ , and then go to the compiler page https://os.mbed.com/compiler, where all your projects are saved. When you compile your project, it is automatically downloaded to your system, and you can drag and drop it to the Nucleo board, in order to start the flashing.


<br>To flash the ESP8266, I used the Arduino IDE. Instructions on how to setup the Arduino IDE to support the ESP8266 can be found on https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/esp8266-thing-hookup-guide
